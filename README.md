6/27: Possible treasure hunt: Find an article (probably by Zieffler, also by Garfield, maybe even Sabbag) that shows one of their diagrams of the simulation process.  We could give 2-3 to Stat 217/218 students this summer and see which the prefer.  See also

Dennis sun was just advocating to me, the text by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves may have an explanation, or perhaps an article by Andrew Gelman??
So I forgot to mention this when we talked today, but it's another way to help visualize that randomization process, do your observation go in this column or in this column?  Rather than does your row read group1 vs. group2? So might be another representation to consider...

I used to have a "[do it yourself glossary](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/workshop-statistics-discovery/9780470542040/48-appendix-a.html url)". Could we "modernize" that and would it be more helpful than our online glossary

Should we look into "stankey diagrams" for comparing pre/post or questions within the same question set?

When you get a chance, can you put your slides from today here or in slack?

Our "teaching inventory"
[Teaching Inventory.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16075152/Teaching.Inventory.pdf)
Do you want to track down the one in JSDSE as well?

Make sure the special SERJ issue didn't already have a big comparison of male/female on cognitive competence (but still wouldn't look at interaction with SBI)?

Tell me more what was different about the assessment questions that Case used and whether we want to try to get our hands on them?
