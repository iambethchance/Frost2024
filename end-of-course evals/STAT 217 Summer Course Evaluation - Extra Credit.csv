This course also helped me become a better writer when explaining concepts. Although lengthy, I found the questions that were ""explain to someone who isn't in statistics"" structured really helpful to clarify my own understanding. I chose no change because this course evened out my statistics knowledge that I had before. ","As a deadline driven student, I understood that the assignments such as labs and investigations were due by the end of the day and not the class, but sometimes on longer labs and investigations, having only one hour (sometimes less) to complete the assignment did make me panic a little as I felt rushed to complete this by the end of class, so sometimes I felt like the goal of class was to complete the assignment, because there wasn't much time to settle with the new information being learned every day. However, I feel like this is more a personal flaw that I can definitely work on. I know the duration of the class is out of the instructor's hands, but maybe allocating a little more time for the group work would have made me a better learner and increase my confidence in my abilities.
