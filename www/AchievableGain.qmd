Empirically, we found having an achievable gain of -1.1 or below to be quite unusual and would recommend filtering out such observations

#### How achievable gain was calculated:

$$
\text{Achievable Gain} = \frac{\text{post test percentage correct} - \text{pre test percentage correct}}{1 - \text{number of test questions}}
$$
